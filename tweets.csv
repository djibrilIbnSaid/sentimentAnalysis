i’m leave this right here…  if donald trump was going to destroy our country he would have done it in his first term.   if kamala harris was going to help our country she would have done it in her first term.

"candace owens discovered that the picture of the lady kamala harris took a picture with, claiming it was her jamaican grandma, died four years before kamala was born  how do you take a picture with someone who died before you were born? 😂  this should be national news right now."

"fox news and other right wing media were all over kamala harris wearing an $800 pair of earrings at the dnc.  for some reason they seem to have missed that donald trump is hawking $100,000 watches.  so i'll help them out. @foxnews https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2024/09/26/trump-promotes-trump-watches-as-latest-merchandise-endeavor/"

"after almost four years, border czar kamala harris has decided, for political reasons, that it’s time for her to go to our broken southern border. what a disgrace that she waited so long, allowing millions of people to enter our country from prisons, mental institutions, and criminal cells all over the world, not just south america, many of those coming are terrorists, and at a level never seen before! she’s trying to con the public like she did a good job at the border when, in fact, she has destroyed the very fabric of our nation allowing 21 million people in from places unknown.  when kamala is seen at the border on friday, she will pass hundreds of miles of wall that was built by trump, and it is wall that works! when she speaks, be advised that this woman has allowed more than 21 million people into our country, totally unvetted, and from places unknown. they are now creating criminal havoc all throughout the country. every state is a border state! when she speaks, i hope everybody remembers that she has caused our cities, towns, and country itself, tremendous damage, and only i can fix it!"

"how can we trust @kamalaharris on anything? she told oprah that if you break into her house, she’ll shoot you like dirty harry. but in 2007, she sponsored a bill to confiscate every handgun in the city and bragged about going into americans’ homes for their guns. this is the most committed leftist a major party has ever nominated. kamala would want to seize your handguns by force, while she lets violent migrants into the country, who will be allowed to vote when she gives them amnesty… and they’ll be given checks to buy homes in your neighborhood… and free sex changes too!"

"bill maher:   “let's talk a little about the international scene. the long awaited second front in the israeli war seems to have started this week, not just the pagers, but they're bombing all over lebanon, yesterday and today. here's what kamala harris said this week, about what we should do when the war is over. no reoccupation of gaza, no changing of the territorial lines of gaza, and an ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability. i feel like if that's what you have to say, don't say anything.  just shut up. i mean, everybody who talks about israel these days is just so full of it. i mean, or just not you know? i don't want children to die. duh.  who does? none of us want children to die. none of us want this war to go on, but it's not addressing what the problem is. the problem is that one side wants a two-state solution or at least always did. it's a little more right-wing now.  i'm talking about israel, but that still has been their position. one side never did and still doesn't. one side uses terrorism to get their goals. one side retaliates against terrorism. one side is accused of genocide but doesn't do it.  the other side actually would love to do it. people keep saying israel has the right to defend itself. and then whenever israel does, they object to it. well, yeah. i mean, this is one of the astonishing things about the response to the pager bombings.  i understand how people are upset about the sight of gaza being bombed. they're being bombed because hamxs hides beneath and behind its own population to cynically exploit their deaths. but then the israelis turn around with the most astonishingly well-targeted attack in history, like, literally going off in the hands of any hezbollah member who has one of these pagers. and you have people like congresswoman aoc, lambasting israel, the head of the un lambasting israel. so they say israel's entitled to self-defense, but there's no conceivable self-defense that they're actually prepared to defend for the israelis.  i'm glad the israelis are taking matters into their own hands. they just took care of a terrorist who had the death of 300 americans on their hands going back to 1983. he had a $7,000,000 state department bounty on his head. if i were anthony blinken, i would pay the israelis $7,000,000 and say thank you for avenging the death of our marines.” via @billmaher"
